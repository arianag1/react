Project Info

Purpose: To create a Quzzical application. The application should pull questions from a question API 
(https://opentdb.com/api_config.php), and then show the questions on the screen per the figma design 
(https://www.figma.com/file/gYMvRiGFeH16tsCaygjSrR/Quizzical-App-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1&t=ThehngkUBd78aWRF-0). 
The inital Quizzical application should show the title, subtitle and then a "Start quiz" button. When the 
button is clicked, the screen should change to show a display of all of the questions 
(refer to the Figma design for more details). When the use starts the quiz they should be able to click on 
the answer they think is correct for each question, when they are finished choosing their answers ("check answers" is clicked), 
the use should be able to see whether the answers that they chose are correct or incorrect. Use React hooks such as useEffect 
and useState to accomplish the goals of this applications.
